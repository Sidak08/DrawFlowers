# AFlowerForYou

## Overview
"AFlowerForYou" is a unique code-based artwork that generates a one-of-a-kind flower just for you. The project originated as a Mother's Day gift, but its beauty and uniqueness extend far beyond any specific occasion. Each flower created is a random combination of shapes and patterns, ensuring that your flower is truly uniqueâ€”one out of 80,028,000 possibilities.

## Inspiration
The inspiration for "AFlowerForYou" came from the desire to create a special and personal gift. Although originally intended for Mother's Day, the project evolved into a broader exploration of creativity and coding. The experience of building it was both challenging and rewarding, involving a mix of trial and error, as well as a deeper dive into trigonometry and geometric principles.

## Development Experience
Developing "AFlowerForYou" was a mostly positive experience, though not without its challenges. Initially, I overlooked the documentation available for the Blot framework and relied heavily on trial and error, along with my trusted console log. Even after discovering the docs, I found certain features, like creating a circle, to be less straightforward than expected. However, this allowed me to refresh my trigonometry skills, which was an unexpected but welcome challenge.

This project also marked my return to coding after a two-month break due to school and exams. The last time I coded was at a hackathon, and working on "AFlowerForYou" rekindled my passion for creating something unique and personal.

## Code Explanation
The code consists of several functions that generate various components of the flower, such as petals, circles, and stems. The values of these components are randomly generated to ensure that each flower is unique. Below is a brief overview of the key functions:

- **getCirclePoints**: Generates the points of a circle based on its radius and center.
- **genRanCir**: Creates a randomized circle shape using a turtle graphics approach.
- **genPetal**: Generates the petals of the flower by connecting points on concentric circles.
- **genStem**: Creates the stem of the flower, connecting it to the petals.
- **genFlower**: Combines all the components to generate the complete flower.

You can customize the flower by modifying the constants in the code to achieve different visual effects.
